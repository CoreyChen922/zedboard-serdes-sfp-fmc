Example design for the SERDES SFP FMC on the ZedBoard

### Description

This project demonstrates the Opsero SERDES SFP FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card).
In this design, the Zynq PS constructs a packet in the DDR3 memory and then
uses the AXI DMA to send the packet through the serial transmitter. The
packet is sent through two SFP modules connected by a fiber patch cable
and returns through the serial receiver and back into the FPGA. The AXI DMA
receives the packet and writes it to memory, where the Zynq PS can verify
the received data.

### Requirements

To use this design, you will need to have two (2) SFP modules that can be
used to loopback the two transceivers of the SERDES SFP FMC. The model of
SFP module used is not particularly important, but it must support at least
3.125Gbps. The SFP used for testing the design was the Cisco DS-SFP-FC4G-SW
which you can easily find on Amazon.com.

Alternatively, you can buy an SFP loopback cable.
